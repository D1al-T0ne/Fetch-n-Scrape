# Fetch-n-Scrape

These are works in progress to help me learn Python, and maybe lead to something constructive!

### About
gbjs.py - Fetches, .js URL links and saves them while beautifying them.

jsfiles.py - A quick function to extract .js URLs from a list of URLs.

link-maker.py - Takes in a file of subdomains and creates an HTML page of clickable links.

patterns.py - Takes in a text file of known patterns and looks for matches in another provided file.

screenshot.py - Grabs a screenshot of a website and saves to a file in a created directory.

statuscode.py - Takes in a file of Hosts, URLs or IPs and returns the status code for each.

### TODO
Lots! Breakdown what needs to be worked on for each.
