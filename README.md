# Fetch-n-Scrape

These are works in progress to help me learn Python, and maybe lead to something constructive!

### About
cname.py - A simple dns resolver, checking if a hostname resolves to an A or CNAME record and provides the IP.

href.py - Takes in a file of URLs and creates clickable links.

jsfiles.py - A quick function to extract .js files from a file.

patterns.py - Takes in a text file of known patterns and looks for matches in another provided file.

screenshot.py - Gabs a screenshot of a website and saves to a file in a created directory.

status.py - Returns the status code for a requested URL.

### TODO
Lots! Breakdown what needs to be worked on for each.

### Feedback
If you have any tips or improvement ideas I should be working on please let me [know.](https://github.com/D1al-T0ne/Fetch-n-Scrape/issues)
